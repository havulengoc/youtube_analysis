The source code is written in R, from a `RMarkdown` file, a part of `R Studio`. To display the file or replicate the work/code done in the file, the installation of `RStudio` (https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) is required. 

Besides that, we used different packages, and each of them should be installed before running the `RMarkdown` file. Here are the main packages that we used in the `RMarkdown` file:
+ `tidyverse`
+ `ggplot2`
+ `dplyr`
+ `lubridate`
